title: "A year in review: 2020"
---

[Disclaimer: work in progress]


Following the lead of [Taylor Barnett](https://taylorbar.net/posts/2020-in-review/), I decided to build a list of what I did during this special year.
My main goal with that post is to remember all the cool things that happened in 2020 and all the most notable things I achieved (like a huge feel good jar).

# Blog posts
I wrote 4 blog posts on Doctolib's medium account. A bit of tech, a bit of organization, and a bit of management:
* [So, what’s the fuss about those “Fresh eyes reports”, Doctolib? (Feb 7, 2020)](https://medium.com/doctolib/so-whats-the-fuss-about-those-fresh-eyes-reports-doctolib-8e31db885ea5)
* [One to three deployments per day: push where it hurts (Apr 16, 2020)](https://medium.com/doctolib/one-to-three-deployments-per-day-push-where-it-hurts-a1f465593237)
* [Understanding and fixing N+1 query (Jul 10, 2020)](https://medium.com/doctolib/understanding-and-fixing-n-1-query-30623109fe89)
* [Becoming an Engineering Manager (Dec 3, 2020)](https://medium.com/doctolib/becoming-an-engineering-manager-a612de1c6aaf)

# Events
I participated and co-organized several events:
* Wild Code School Hackathon: >400 attendees. 13 Coaches. 3 Winners.
* Microsoft Roadshow Fall 2020: Charity bike run + Tech talks + Quantum computing trainings.
* Start and Restart of the [Contribute events](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/doctolib): An event to help aspiring open source contributors start their first PR.
* Co-authored [Doctolib's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/doctolib/code-of-conduct)

# Talks
I had the chance to speak at several events about what we do at Doctolib:

* [MUG Orléans (Oct 2020): How our company of 1500 people (Doctolib) went remote over the weekend]()
* [MUG Tours (Oct 2020): How to manage your legacy code]()

# Coaching
I spent countless hours coaching people at Doctolib on:
* How to write efficiently a good blog post
* How to structure your ideas in order to tell a good story
* How to structure a talk
* Individual management topics
* Social media bootcamp
* Building and organizing a training
* Organizing and hosting an online meetup
* How to work remotely

# Code
* Added and removed a few lines of code in the Doctolib's monolith, based on our Patient Identity Management roadmap (Data mode migration with relation cardinality changes over massive tables (several hundred millions records))
* Greenhouse tag matrix migration: I built a tool that cleaned and updated 100k candidates profiles in our ATS (which does not allow batch iterations over custom fields) in a couple of days.
* I participated to the Advent Of Code, and ended up 2nd on the Doctolib's internal leaderboard (I'm not obsolete yet! Yay!).
* I discovered quantum computing and Q#, and trained a few students

# 3D Printing
I learned about 3D printing during the first national lockdown and made it a hobby of mine:
* Bought a French Dagoma 3D printer
* Learned about Cura by Dagoma (a custom version of Cura)
* Fought with my printer to get it to work with the official Cura release and won
* Installed an Octoprint instance on a raspberry pi, configured a webcam on it and a ngrok tunnel and started to print things when not at home (Yay, video streaming!)
* Decided to offer myself a nice 40th birthday gift and bought a Prusa MK3S
* Waited almost 2 months to get it 😅
* Got it, built it, loved it
* Started to build my own models with Tinkercad
* Tried Blender
* Learned a bit of OpenSCAD (enough to build a door holder)
* Tried Fusion 360
* Built a ton of functional stuff (door holder, laptop stand, webcam support, smartphone holder, etc)

# Interesting reads
* My throwback read: The Belgariad and The Malloreon (David Eddings). I read it every 20 years 🤓
* Best management read: The manager's path, by Camille Fournier (Super useful book that walk you through all the steps of tech management, from tech lead to engineering director)
* [Developers job is not about writing code](https://www.aleksandra.codes/jira-to-javascript), by Aleksandra Sikora

# Misc/Unusual
* I did ride a bike for >430km during the Microsoft Roadshow and helped raise more than 4k euros for "Les Blouses Roses" (a French charity taking care of kids and elders).
* Brewed a successful batch of Pale Ale with a custom recipe.
