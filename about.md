# Who am I ?

Alexandre Ignjatovic

French software engineer, born in 1980.

Working at [Follow Analytics](http://followanalytics.com) since beginning of 2014 as technical lead.

Previously working around 10 years in financial software craftmanship. Tried a lots of different things (managed/unmanaged C++, C#, a lot of SQL databases, Perl, Linux, Windows, .Net, etc.)

Those days, I'm:

* Designing data architecture (AWS Redshift, Redis, Postgres, Mongodb) and scalable software (Ruby/RoR)
* Working hard to reduce our technical debt
* Trying to share as much as possible with the dev team

I really like to design an produce systems that work and are able to scale. I'm deeply concerned when it comes to software maintainability,

# What's that title ?

In that title, [_Polymérisation_ (fr)](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymérisation) stands for [_polymerization_ (en)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerization) (and _concept_... Well, it is the very same word in french and english ;)).

From Wikipedia, it can be read that:

> In polymer chemistry, polymerization is a process of reacting monomer molecules together in a chemical reaction to form polymer chains or three-dimensional networks.

From my point of view, software craftmanship can be seen as the very same thing:

> Aggregating small concepts to make larger systems (able to be aggregated as well in even larger systems).

# hobbies ?

Lots of. So many more than my free time allow it, sadly. When I find some time, I enjoy:

* Archery
* Books. All of them (technical, classical or contemporary, mangas... Anything I can get my hand on, actually)
* Music. Quite a large range of it (classical, rock, Hip hop, Electro, folk, etc.)

# Achievements ?

* I managed to design and carry on a full backend migration from mongo to AWS Redshift in six months for an analytics platform
* I designed and developed a working real time funnel calculation system based on AWS Redshift
* I sewn a shirt. With sleeves. Yep, I'm that kind of a polymorph geek :)
